# Working Group Leadership

How Working Group (WG) leadership is defined and roles within the WGs.  Anyone can be a part of a Working Group and participate in calls and code writing and review.

## Working Group Steering Committee

- Each WG is administered by a WG Steering Committee (“WGSC”).

- WGSC members serve a one year term.
- The WGSC members can be an employee or representative of a Member of the Foundation, must be nominated by the member who employs or engages them, and serve subject to the consent of that member.
- WGSC shall elect one or two chairs from among its members, who serve at the pleasure of the WGSC members. One chair can be required by the WGSC to be a city representative.
